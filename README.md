# bilingual blog

## overview

A bilingual website built with Handlebars.js informing about direct import initiatives in Berlin. Initiatives can register/login, post information about them and add a logo or a picture. A language-switcher allows users to switch between German and English content. The features also include the possibility to edit the project's profile and a blog for news and events.
